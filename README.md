## What is Cypress?

Cypress is an open-source JavaScript end-to-end testing framework designed for web applications. It simplifies the process of writing, running, and debugging tests. Cypress provides a powerful and intuitive interface for testing, making it easier to ensure your applications function as expected.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Reloads**: Cypress tests automatically reload as you make changes to your code.
- **Automatic Waiting**: No need for manual waits or sleeps; Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear.
- **Network Traffic Control**: Stub and control network requests and responses for comprehensive testing.
- **Debugging**: Rich error messages and visual snapshots of your application state at the time of failure.
- **Time Travel**: View snapshots of your application at each step of the test.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing Cypress, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js**: Cypress requires Node.js v14 or higher. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't installed it yet.
- **Visual Studio Code**: This guide assumes you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as your code editor. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if necessary.

### Install Cypress on Windows

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**: Launch VS Code on your Windows machine.

2. **Open Terminal**: 
   - You can open the terminal in VS Code by navigating to `View` > `Terminal`.

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: 
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the root directory of your project.
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\project
     ```

4. **Initialize a Node.js Project** (if not already done):
   - Run the following command to create a `package.json` file:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```

5. **Install Cypress**:
   - Run the following command to install Cypress as a development dependency:
     ```bash
     npm install cypress --save-dev
     ```

6. **Open Cypress**:
